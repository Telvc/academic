abstract: 
We study the problem of community recovery and detection in multi-layer stochastic block models, focusing on the critical network density threshold for consistent community structure inference. Using a prototypical two-block model, we reveal a computational barrier for such multi-layer stochastic block models that does not exist for its single-layer counterpart\: When there are no computational constraints, the density threshold depends linearly on the number of layers. However, when restricted to polynomial-time algorithms, the density threshold scales with the square root of the number of layers, assuming correctness of a low-degree polynomial hardness conjecture. Our results provide a nearly complete picture of the optimal inference in multiple-layer stochastic block models and partially settle the open question in Jing Lei (2022) regarding the optimality of the bias-adjusted spectral method.
